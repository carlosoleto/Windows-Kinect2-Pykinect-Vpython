# Windows-Kinect2-Pykinect-Vpython
How to start developing 3D apps with Kinect2 data in Windows with Vpython

The main reason of this project is to give a nice and fast start for anyone who wants do read data from Kinect2 (Kinect ONE) and with some python language do some work.

Here we use Vpython version 6 (the good one) to accomplished  the mission.

First, follow the steps in: https://github.com/Kinect/PyKinect2

REMEMBER!!! The version of ANACONDA is 32bits.

If you would like to proceed and test with the Pykinect2 and Pygame, go for it, the example is great to learn about the wrapper. But you can skip that.

Next install Vpython 6 (be carefull, the number is 6): 

conda install -c mwcraig vpython

Now, if everything is working: 

Start python, and type:

from visual import *
from pykinect2 import PyKinectV2

If nothing happens that's good.

And finally download the file from this git and run:
python demonstracao.py

Enjoy, stay positive.
